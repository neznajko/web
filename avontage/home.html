intrinsic-value-according-to-buffett-and-munger/

Intrinsic value is perhaps one of the most important concepts in
value investing as it determines whether a stock offers value or
not.
But it is also one of the most confounding concepts.
The simplest explanation of intrinsic value is offered by Warren
Buffett himself.
It is the "discounted value of the cash that can be taken out
of a business during its remaining life."
The definition alone opens up a Pandora's box. 
Estimating how much cash the business can generate during its
remaining lifetime may be complicated.
If you manage to do that successfully, then there is the grey
area of using discounting - what rate to use?
Buffett has not explicitly mentioned how he calculates intrinsic
value, though he has dropped broad hints about how he goes about
it.
But because there is no clarity about intrinsic value, analysts
and investors try very hard to get intrinsic value right and
that is where many falter.

Busting the Myth As Charlie Munger points out, it may not be
easy to pin down intrinsic value. He says, "When you're trying
to determine intrinsic value and margin of safety, there's no
one easy method that can simply be mechanically applied by a
computer that will make someone who pushes the buttons rich. You
have to apply a lot of models. I don't think you can become a
great investor rapidly, no more than you can become a bone-tumor
pathologist quickly". (Berkshire Annual Meeting 2007).

Here is an easy explanation by Buffett of intrinsic value. Says
Buffett, "Let's say you decide you want to buy a farm and you
make calculations that you can make $70/acre as the owner. How
much will you pay [per acre for that farm]? Do you assume
agriculture will get better so you can increase yields? Do you
assume prices will go up? You might decide you wanted a 7 per
cent return, so you'd pay $1,000/acre. If it's for sale at $800,
you buy, but if it's at $1,200, you don't." (Berkshire Annual
Meeting 2007).

Here's another way to look at intrinsic value. "If you were
thinking about paying $900,000 or $1.3 million for a McDonald's
stand, you'd think about things like whether people will keep
eating hamburgers and whether McDonald's could change the
franchise agreement. You have to know what you're doing and
whether you're within your circle of competence," said
Buffett. (Berkshire Annual Meeting 2008).  In his 2010 Annual
Letter Buffett described a "Two-Column Valuation Method" to
arrive at the Intrinsic value. Using Berkshire as an example he
divided his firm into investments and non-insurance
business. The first part involved arriving at the per share
investments. Next he calculated the pre-tax earnings of his
other businesses and applied an appropriate multiple to the
earnings. Finally he added this amount to the per share
investments to arrive at the intrinsic value.

At best, intrinsic value is an estimate. "Intrinsic value is an
estimate rather than a precise figure, and it is additionally an
estimate that must be changed if interest rates move or
forecasts of future cash flows are revised." You don't need to
get intrinsic value figures right to the second decimal
place. Buffett points out, "If we see someone who weighs 300 or
320 pounds, it doesn't matter - we know they're fat. We look for
fat businesses.'' (Berkshire Annual Meeting 2007).

Intrinsic value can sometimes be much lower than the company's
stated book value. In the "Owners Manual" dated 1999, Buffet
gave the example of Berkshire in 1964. The book value of
Berkshire was $19.46/share. According to Buffett, the intrinsic
value was far lower because Berkshire was struggling in a low
profitability textile business. The textile assets did not have
going-concern or liquidation values equal to their carrying
values.

In the end, it pays to keep in mind Munger's statement when
considering Intrinsic value. "We have no system for estimating
the correct value of all businesses. We put almost all in the
'too hard' pile and sift through a few easy ones". (Berkshire
Annual Meeting 2007).
